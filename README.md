# POC 

> Discriminator field issue

## What I want
Find a base model in a npm repo. Then extend it in an app repo. The sub model should be of right type.
See `/packages/app-repo/store/index.ts`

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
